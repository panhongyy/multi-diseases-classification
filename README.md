# multi-diseases-classification

  In this study we present a lightweight multi-disease network based on ShuffleNet V2 and transfer learning to jointly classify normal and DME using OCT images; normal and Pneumonia using X rays images; normal and Alzheimer's disease using MR images, respectively. We constructed a sample data set based on 2014_BOE_Srinivasan and OCT2017 datasets of retinal OCT image, ChestXRay2017, and Collected MR images from multiple common repositories. As training images, 1097 normal images were selected from 2014_BOE_Srinivasan and 1097 DME images from OCT2017, 1349 normal and 3883 pneumonia images from the ChestXRay2017, 3200 normal and 3200 Alzheimer's disease MR images from multiple common repositories. Simultaneously we selected 120 normal from 2014_BOE_Srinivasan and 120 DME images from OCT2017, 234 normal and 390 pneumonias from the testing of ChestXRay2017, 100 normal and 100 MR images of Alzheimer's disease from multiple common repositories, as testing images. The original images were divided into training set and validation set according to the ratio of 9:1, then the image was cropped, the aspect ratio is cropped to 1:1, and finally the image was resized to 128 Ã— 128.
